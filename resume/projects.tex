    {August 2019 - September 2019} % Date
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
        \item {Implemented and used hashtables to make a database of student records in Java, and implemented commands to update/query the database}
        \item {Experimented with different types of collision resolution techniques in hashing like seperate chaining, double hashing, and analysed their efficiency in the database}
        \item {Also implemented a binary search tree in seperate chaining, for faster querying}
      \end{cvitems}

    {August 2019 - September 2019} % Date
    {
      \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
      	\item {Used multithreading to implement a buyer seller platform in Java by modelling it as a multiple Producer-Consumer problem}
      	\item {Used ReentrantLock and Condition objects to properly manage sharing of resources and prevent deadlocks during concurrent buy/sell operations on the same product}

    {}
    {March 2019 - April 2019}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Made an Automated Night Lamp on a breadboard using Light Dependent Resistor, Relay, and an Operational Amplifier(op-amp) used as a voltage comparator}
        \item {Used a transistor as a switch which receives the output of the voltage comparator(op-amp) and thus switches the relay depending on the op-amp's output}

    {LHospital - Hospital Management Database}
    {}
    {July 2017 - January 2018}
    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Used Object Oriented Principles extensively in C++ for developing a database for all employees, patients, stock, budget etc. for a typical hospital}
        \item {Developed the database heirarchy of different types of hospital employees, including methods to add/remove/update/view employee data, pay salaries }
        \item {Worked on designing a text-based user interface that facilitates the operations implemented in the database}
        \item {
          Implemented a user account system for all employees in the hospital, with different access levels for different types of employees
          \begin{itemize} 
            \item {Uses a login and and an encrypted password}
            \item {Password is stored as a vigenere cipher}
          \end{itemize}
        }
        \item {Worked in a team of 3, used Git and GitHub extensively for collaboration}
