    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Made an Automated Night Lamp on a breadboard using Light Dependent Resistor, Relay, and an Operational Amplifier(op-amp) used as a voltage comparator}
        \item {Used a transistor as a switch which receives the output of the voltage comparator(op-amp) and thus switches the relay depending on the op-amp's output}

    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item {Used Object Oriented Principles extensively in C++ for developing a database for all employees, patients, stock, budget etc. for a typical hospital}
        \item {Developed the database heirarchy of different types of hospital employees, including methods to add/remove/update/view employee data, pay salaries }
        \item {Worked on designing a text-based user interface that facilitates the operations implemented in the database}
        \item {
          Implemented a user account system for all employees in the hospital, with different access levels for different types of employees
          \begin{itemize} 
            \item {Uses a login and and an encrypted password}
            \item {Password is stored as a vigenere cipher}
